## Ideas

- Some default stuff:
    - Turn on names R2 -> All tail games
    - Need to check the flyby to know some stuff (Wall Guys, Dizzy Heights, Pipe Dream, Fall Mountain)
- free text search in all headers to quickly go to a page? (could do the search like in blog)
- fix main page layout on small devices. on small devices the level-detail back button isn't showing (float: right?).
- levels: add buttons to show only races/survival + select season(s) filters
- "Abandoned" shortcuts: no longer viable since update xyz (am using obsolete: true already somewhere)
- Need to be able to fold certain sections (ex: max 4 shown, other need a click to open)
- Fall Guys TV: "Hide This" button

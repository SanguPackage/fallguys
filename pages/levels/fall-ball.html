<h2>Defending</h2>

- Jump: counter an attack



<h2>Attacking</h2>

The best attack is probably the dive.

This depends a bit on the amount of lag/desync but when you get so close to the ball that your arms are about to go up to get the bean
into the ball-pushing position, that is the time to dive.
Watch out for someone behind the ball as that could trigger an unstoppable counter.

When your teammate is about to hit the dive button for an attack and you are behind the ball with an opponent, grab that opponent to prevent him from getting a jump/dive counter.


<h2>The Start</h2>>

If a teammate dives the ball forward towards a teammate running forward from the start, your game of fall ball might very well see it's first goal in the first seconds.




And remember: if no one in your team is goalie, you are!

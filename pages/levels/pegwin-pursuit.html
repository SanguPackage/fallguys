Hold one of the three pegwins to score points for your team. There is a chance for a golden pegwin to spawn in the middle (double points).

<br><br>

Like with all grabbing levels:

<ul>
    <li>You walk slower when grabbing, so your pursuers are bound to catch up when you are holding a pegwin</li>
    <li>If you get grabbed with a pegwin while in the air, the pegwin will pop off in a random direction</li>
    <li>If you get grabbed with a pegwin, release it and pick it back up after the grab. Continueing to hold the pegwin while being grabbed will also result in the pegwin popping off in a random direction</li>
    <li>Protect your teammates holding a pegwin by grabbing opponent beans as they come close</li>
</ul>

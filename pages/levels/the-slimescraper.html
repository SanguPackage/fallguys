  - name: "The Start"
    leading: >
      <p>The start is all about getting to that second Flippity Bippity (aka: flipper) before the crowd arrives.
      You make the jumps there and you will be way ahead everyone else.</p>

      <p>You can get yourself killed if you fall off the second flipper on the side of the slime
      and it Flippities while you are falling. Something to keep in mind.</p>

      <p>It takes some time for the slime to arrive here so you have about 3-5 attempts to get the shortcut.</p>

        leading: >
          If you use this trick, best is to wait until the Force-Field appears and then make the jump+dive.
          It might seem the easiest but is not our recommended way as it is a bit finicky,
          sometimes you won't jump far enough, or too far.

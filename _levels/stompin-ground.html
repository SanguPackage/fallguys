There are a few strategies in use. It doesn't seem like there is a 100% effective one though..
<br>
My strategy is to try and keep all three rhinos in my line of sight at all times while also trying to keep
as much distance as possible between me and the nearest rhino and avoid crowded areas.
<br>
If there are no other beans between a rhino and myself, I start jumping so that the rhino will change targets.
<br><br>
Some pointers and strategies:

<ul>
    <li>Avoid crowds: the rhinos seem attracted to them</li>
    <li>Large Hitbox: those rhinos will hit your bean while it really didn't seem so</li>
    <li>Spam Jump: usefli when there are not many beans left: a rhino does not see you while jumping around</li>
    <li>Lily Pads: it's possible to keep jumping on the same lily pad over and over but even that is no guarantee</li>
    <li>Variant with spinning disc in the middle: stay on the disc at all times and it sholid be an easy qual</li>
    <li>Circling the edge of the map: some swear by it</li>
    <li>Staying in the middle: uhoh, seems risky to me ðŸ˜€</li>
</ul>

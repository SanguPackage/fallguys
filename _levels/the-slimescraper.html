  - name: "The Start"
    leading: >
      The start is all about getting to that second Flippity Bippity (aka: flipper) before the crowd arrives.
      You make the jumps there and you will be way ahead of everyone else.
      <br>
      You can get yourself killed if you fall off the second flipper on the side of the slime
      and it Flippities while you are falling. Something to keep in mind.
      <br>
      It takes some time for the slime to arrive here so you have about 3-5 attempts to get the shortcut.

        leading: >
          If you use this trick, best is to wait until the Force-Field appears and then make the jump+dive.
          It might seem the easiest but is not our recommended way as it is a bit finicky,
          sometimes you won't jump far enough, or too far.

There are always <b>2 sections with bubbles</b>. They will only respawn at a different section when ALL bubbles in another section have been captured!
If there is seemingly only one section with bubbles, there is probably a golden one left somewhere...
<br>
Each golden bubble is good for <b>5 points</b>.
